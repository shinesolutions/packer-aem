AWS Resources
-------------

For creating AEM AWS AMIs, the following resources must be available:

- Create an IAM Instance Profile for Packer AEM to use, check out the [example Cloud Formation template](https://github.com/shinesolutions/packer-aem/blob/master/examples/aws/packer-instance-profile.yaml)
- Create an S3 Bucket path for storing AEM artifacts, this bucket path needs to be set in `aws.aem_artifacts_base` [configuration](https://github.com/shinesolutions/packer-aem/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) property
- Upload the required AEM artifacts to the above location, the required artifacts will depend on `aem.profile` configuration. Check out the [artifacts list](https://github.com/shinesolutions/puppet-aem-curator/blob/master/docs/aem-profiles-artifacts.md) required for a given AEM profile
- Upload your certificate to [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home). The resulting ARN needs to be set in the `aws.certificate_arn` [configuration](https://github.com/shinesolutions/packer-aem/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) property
