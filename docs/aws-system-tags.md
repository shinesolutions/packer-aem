AWS System Tags
---------------

In order to identify the AWS resources (e.g. EC2 instance, AMI, volumes) that are used as part of AEM AMIs creation process, the following system tags are set up following [AWS Tagging Strategies](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/):

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Version | The `version` parameter value passed to AMI creation command, e.g. `make version=123` |
| Name | The AMI name to be displayed on AWS console `<component> AMI <version>` |
| Application Id | Value is `Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)` |
| Application Role | Value is `<component> AMI` |
| Application Profile | Value is the configured AEM profile, check out the [list of available profiles](https://github.com/shinesolutions/puppet-aem-curator/blob/master/docs/aem-profiles-artifacts.md) |
| OS Type | Value is the configured `os_type` |

If you're looking to add custom tags, please check out the [configuration page](https://github.com/shinesolutions/packer-aem/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).
